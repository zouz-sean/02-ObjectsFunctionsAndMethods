#   READ the code above.  Be sure you understand:
#     -- How many functions are defined above?
#           (Answer: 4)
#     -- For each function definition:
#          -- Where does that function definition begin?
#             Where does it end?
#     -- How many times does   main   call the   turtle1   function?

#     -- How many times does   main   call the   turtle2   function?
#            (Hint: the answer is NOT 1.)

# TODO: 4.
#   Define another function,
#   immediately below the end of the definition of   turtle3   above.
#   Name your new function   turtle4.
#
#   The Python "pep8" coding standard says to leave exactly 2 blank
#   lines between function definitions, so be sure to do so.
#
#   Your new function should:
#    1. Define a SimpleTurtle.
#    2. Set your SimpleTurtle's
#               pen
#       to a new rg.Pen with a color and thickness of your own choosing.
#       The  COLORS.txt  file in this project has a list of legal color-names.
#    3. Make your SimpleTurtle move around a bit.

#
#   BTW, if you see a RED underline, that means that there is

# TODO: 5.
#   Add a line to   main   that CALLS your new function immediately
#   AFTER  main  calls turtle1.  So:
#     -- the SimpleTurtle from turtle1 should move,
#     -- then YOUR SimpleTurtle should move,
#     -- then the other 3 SimpleTurtles should move.
#
#   Run this module.  Check that there is another SimpleTurtle (yours)
#   that uses the pen you chose and moves around a bit.
#   If your code has errors (shows RED in the Console window)
#   or does not do what it should, get help as needed to fix it.

#   Now implement AND test one more function, defining it immediately
#   below the definition of your   turtle4   function.
#   Name your new function   turtle5.
#
#   The Python "pep8" coding standard says to leave exactly 2 blank
#   lines between function definitions, so be sure to do so.
#
#   Your new function should define TWO new SimpleTurtles,
#   set their characteristics (i.e., instance variables) as you choose,
#   and make each move a bit.

#   COMMIT and PUSH your work (after changing this TO-DO to DONE).
#
#   As a reminder, here is how you should do so:
#     1. Select   VCS   from the menu bar (above).
#     2. Choose  Commit  from the pull-down menu that appears.
#     3. In the  Commit Changes  window that pops up:
#          - HOVER over the  Commit  button
#              (in the lower-right corner of the window)
#          - CLICK on  Commit and Push.
#          - (if asked again to Push, select Push)
#
#   COMMIT adds the changed work to the version control on your computer
#   and PUSH adds the changed work into your Github repository in the "cloud".
#
#    COMMIT-and-PUSH your work as often as you want, but for sure
#    after you have tested the module and believe that it is correct.
